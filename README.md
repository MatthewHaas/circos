Creating a circos plot for Zizania

Files referenced in the circos configuration file (circos.conf) have been put into sub-directories based on their function.

The karyotype file specifies how long each chromosome is. Chromosomes were shrunk proportionally (by a factor of 23) compared to actual size.

Files that draw links between _Orzya sativa_ and _Zizania palustris_ can be found in the "links" directory.
Files that make heatmaps for retrotransposon (LTR-retrotransposons specifically) density are found in the "retrotransposon" directory.
Files that make heatmaps for SNP density are found in the "snp_density" directory.
